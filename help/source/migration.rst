HubOps Migration FAQ
===========================

What is getting transferred
---------------------------
All the data relevant to Hub Operations (HubOps) plaform will be transferred.
This includes

- Members
- Usages
- Invoices
- Billing profiles
- Tariffs
- Resources

What is missing if compared to hubspace
---------------------------------------
While there are many new good things with HubOps there are a few features of hubspace are not there yet. We will implement most of them in due course. However it is data transfer which the highest priority at this moment. That way we get rid of old expensive to maintain and technically outdated systems and move on to new platforms. Once we transfer all the hubs we can focus back on features and things will start moving faster.

Our members uses hubspace to make the bookings and manage their profiles
------------------------------------------------------------------------
HubOps is primarily Hosts platform.
So till members platform work is complete, we agreed to setup a minimal booking page for members. This page will be available as a page within existing microsites. Other things such as search/profiles will not be available here.

HubOps URL and access details
-----------------------------
http://ops.the-hub.net

Credentials (i.e. username and password) are same as hubspace credentials.

Member login URL
----------------
Same as microsite URL. On your microsite click on login and member will be prompted to username/password which is same as old hubspace password.
